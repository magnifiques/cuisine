# About the App
Cuisine is designed to make ordering food easy and comfortable. Whether you‚Äôre craving Japanese sushi or Thai curry, Cuisine has got you covered with a diverse range of options. The app features:

- 15 different cuisine categories to suit every taste.
- Around 75 restaurants across Toronto to choose from, ensuring you have various dining options.

# A Bit of Backstory
My journey into mobile app development started with Android Studio, but the process was quite complex and challenging. The need to master Java for Android and Swift for iOS seemed overwhelming, and I eventually stopped learning mobile app development altogether.

However, after 2 years, I was introduced to Expo and React Native, which reignited my interest and passion for mobile development.
