## A Bit of Backstory
My journey into mobile app development started with Android Studio, but I found the process quite complex and challenging. The need to master Java for Android and Swift for iOS seemed overwhelming, and I eventually stopped learning mobile app development altogether.

However, after 2 years, I was introduced to Expo and React Native, which reignited my interest and passion for mobile development.

## Why I‚Äôm Excited About This Approach
- Unified Development: I can build cross-platform apps using JavaScript and React without learning multiple languages. This has made the development process much more enjoyable and efficient.
- Familiar Tools: Leveraging my experience with JavaScript and React allowed me to dive into mobile development easily and confidently.

## Tech Stack Highlights
- React Native: For a seamless mobile experience.
- Expo: To simplify development and deployment.
